# kmer_finder

kmer_finder is a program used for generating a sorted k-mer sequences according to their frequency in your raw FASTQ file.  

It is a common task for a bioinformatician to find all the k-mer sequences from a raw FASTQ file. For example, as an important part of QC, we usually need to identify whether there are overrepresented sequences in the raw FASTQ file. Also, sequence adaptor is any kind of short DNA sequence serving the scope of fishing a DNA sequence of interest for various purposes. The first part of the NGS workflow typically includes a step to filter or remove (trim) adapter because the adaptor sequence is not DNA sequence we're interested in and don't want to bring them to the downstream analysis. 

kmer_finder was developped to read sequences from a raw FASTQ file and find out the frequency of all substrings with length k across all sequences in FASTQ file.

Example:
    python kmer_finder.py -f rawReads.fastq -k 20 -o output.txt

The input parameters are
    • -f: Raw sequence data in FASTQ format
    • -k: Length of the k-mer
    • -o: output file which includes a sorted list with k-mer sequences according to their frequency

The output file includes 2 columns: 
    • 1st column: k-mer sequence
    • 2nd column: count of k-mer sequence


The manual of kmer_finder is: 

    usage: kmer_finder.py [-h] -f FASTQ -k KMER -o OUTFILE

    Generate a sorted k-mer sequences according to their frequency in the FASTQ data.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -f FASTQ    The raw fastq file
      -k KMER     The length of k-mer
      -o OUTFILE  Output file
